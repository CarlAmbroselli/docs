# Authentication
0. Open a private chat with the bridge bot. Usually `@hangoutsbot:your.server`.
   * If the bot doesn't accept the invite, see the [troubleshooting page](../../general/troubleshooting.md)
1. Send `login`.
2. Open the link sent by the bot and follow the instructions.
   * Automatic login may not work. If it does not, reload the page and select
     the "Manual login" checkbox before starting. Manual login involves logging
     into your Google account normally and then manually getting the OAuth token
     from browser cookies with developer tools.
3. Recent chats should now get portals automatically. Other chats will get
   portals as you receive messages.
